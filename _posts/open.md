The idea here is to have a easy to modify site that can serve the Dublin Indie Hackers community.

For now it's pretty basic, landing page + blog posts, but it doesn't have to be!

## Tech stack

This website is based on [NextJS Blog Starter with Typescript and Markdown](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).

It uses Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.
